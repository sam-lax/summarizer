# summarizer
First attempts at extractive text summarization

## "/resources"
* Simply a directory containing documents that I'd like to have summarized; and
* Archived data (.csv, .txt, .json, etc.) from API calls.

## "summarizer.py"
* This is my first attempt at extractive text summarization using NLTK; and
* My first peek into the world of NLP in any way.

## "watson_NLU.py"
* A simple implementation of the Watson Natural Language Understanding API.
